RWSApps ProgressiveProfiler jQuery Plugin

Automatically saves all form fields into cookies, and then determines which field groups to show based off of previous submissions.

ProgressiveProfiler gives you the ability to control:

    * Which fields are grouped into progressive containers.
    * The length of the cookie lifetime for the progressive property.
    * The ability to enable debugging and automatic disabling of the Progressive Profiling plugin.
